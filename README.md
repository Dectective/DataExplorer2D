# DataExplorer2D
This is a simple tool written by Matlab App Designer that could do very simple data exploration in 2D.
That is, plotting two columns of a Dataframe (saved in .csv format) in two different axis. 
You can run the tool in Matlab.
You need a licensed MATLAB Compilerâ„¢ to make a standalone executable.
Non-commerical use only.

To use the GUI, load the folder location where the .csv is.
You may load multiple .csv with the same Dataframe column names. 
For instance, multiple .csv files with [x1], [y1], [y2] as the Dataframe column names in each file.
