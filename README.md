# DataExplorer2D
This is a simple tool written by Matlab App Designer that could do very simple data exploration in 2D.
That is, plotting two columns of a Dataframe (saved in .csv format) in two different axis.
You can run the tool in Matlab.
You need a licensed MATLAB Compiler™ to make a standalone executable.
Non-commerical use only.
